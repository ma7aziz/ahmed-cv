            <p class="text-dark">After identifying our targeted audience, we will figure out how to most effectively
                communicate with them. What do they respond to and why? This will also inform future marketing ideas and
                creative strategies </p>

            <h4 style="color: #F77358;">TARGETED AUDIENCE</h4>
            <p class="text-dark">There are many ways we will approach a paid campaign, but unless we are targeting the
                right audience then it will be a disaster.
                Here is a rundown of how we can scale the campaign to optimize results:
            </p>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    <span style="color: #F77358; font-weight: 600 ; font-size: 1.2em">Custom</span> Using your customer
                    database, we will use current customers phone numbers, email addresses, and previous online browsing
                    and purchases history etc..

                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: #F77358; font-weight: 600 ; font-size: 1.2em">Lookalike</span> : Now that we
                    have a picture of our customer database, we can find similar users to open up a whole new set of
                    potential customers.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: #F77358; font-weight: 600 ; font-size: 1.2em">Location, Location,
                        Location</span> This is important, especially for a local business. Ads will specifically target
                    a region, city, state, or country that can purchase your products.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: #F77358; font-weight: 600 ; font-size: 1.2em">Age, Gender, Language</span>Unless
                    you’re targeting kids from 1 to 92, honing in on the right age, gender, and native language of users
                    is important to effective marketing.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: #F77358; font-weight: 600 ; font-size: 1.2em">Detailed Targeting</span>
                    This approach is used to target new customers or people who’ve never heard of your business before.
                    It involves demographics, interests, behaviors, and
                    other categories and searches terms
